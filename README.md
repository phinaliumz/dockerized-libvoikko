# Repository for libvoikko-with-enchant Dockerfile

This repository contains a Dockerfile, which builds upon Ubuntu 18.04 and install Enchant spell-checker, with support for Finnish dictionary called libvoikko.

Its meant to be part of test cycle, to spell check files which are given as argument for the image.

I'll try to update documentation when I have finished the test cycle.
